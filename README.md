# Simple Console Countdown Timer

A straightforward and easy-to-use console-based countdown timer written in Python. This utility allows you to set a duration in seconds, and it will count down, displaying the remaining time in a `MM:SS` format.

## Features

* **Customizable Duration:** Set the timer for any number of seconds.
* **Minute:Second Display:** Shows the time in a clear `MM:SS` format.
* **Real-time Countdown:** Updates every second.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple input prompt and "Time's up!" message.
* **Error Handling:** Catches invalid input (non-numbers or non-positive numbers).

## How it Works

The script uses Python's `time` module to pause execution for one second at a time, creating the countdown effect. It calculates minutes and seconds using the `divmod()` function for clean formatting.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x

## How to Run the Application

1.  **Save the Code:**
    * Copy the entire Python code for the timer into a file named `countdown_timer.py` (or any other name ending with `.py`).
2.  **Open Your Terminal/Command Prompt:**
    * Navigate to the directory where you saved `countdown_timer.py` using the `cd` command.
        * Example (Windows): `cd C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\my_scripts`
        * Example (macOS/Linux): `cd ~/Documents/my_scripts`
3.  **Run the Script:**
    * Execute the Python script using the command:
        ```bash
        python countdown_timer.py
        ```

## How to Use

1.  After running the script, you will be prompted to enter the duration:
    ```
    Enter the duration of the timer in seconds:
    ```
2.  Type a positive integer (e.g., `60` for one minute, `300` for five minutes) and press Enter.
3.  The timer will start counting down in the console:
    ```
    00:59
    00:58
    ...
    ```
4.  Once the time reaches zero, it will print "Time's up!".

## Possible Enhancements

* **Sound Notification:** Play a sound when the timer finishes.
* **Pause/Resume Functionality:** Allow the user to pause and resume the countdown.
* **Multiple Timers:** Support running multiple timers concurrently.
* **Background Operation:** Run the timer in the background while the user does other tasks.
* **GUI:** Create a graphical user interface instead of a console-based one using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy.
